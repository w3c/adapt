			<p>Personalization involves tailoring aspects of the user experience to meet the needs and prefences of the user. For example, having familiar terms and symbols is key to many users being able to use the web. However, what is familiar for one user may be unfamiliar to another requiring them to learn new symbols. The challenge has been the ability to identify the types of content in a document that should be adapted to the preferred user experience. The introduction of standardized semantics allows web applications to customize the exposure of that content to one that is familiar to individuals based on their needs and preferences. This specification defines standard semantics to enable user driven personalization such as the association of a user-preferred symbols to elements having those semantics. This ensures that users can quickly find familiar icons, such as a help icon, that apply to user interface elements.</p>

			<h1>Introduction</h1>
                        <p>The goals of this specification include:</p>
                        <ul>
                                <li> expanding the accessibility information that may be supplied by the author;</li>
                                <li> facilitate preference driven individual personalization;</li>
                                <li> enable the author to specify key semantics needed to support users with cognitive i
mpairments</li>
                        </ul>

 <p>This is a proposal to define syntax for adaptable content such as: links, buttons, symbols, help and keyboard. This may be an WAI-ARIA COGA Extension.</p>   

<p>Personalization involves tailoring aspects of the user experience to  meet the preferences or needs of the user. For example, having familiar terms and symbols is key to being able to use the web. However what is familiar for one user may be new for another requiring them to learn new symbols. Personalization could include loading a set of symbols that is appropriate for the specific user, ensuring that all users find the icons simple and familiar.</p>
<p>Technology holds the  promise of being extremely flexible and the design of many systems includes the  expectation that users will be able to optimise their interaction experience  according to their personal preferences or accessibility  requirements (needs).  </p>
			<section class="section" id="why_accessibility">
				<h2>Why We Need Personalization</h2>
				<p>We need personalization  because:  </p>
    					<ul>
      						<li>Different user needs can conflict</li>
      						<li>Learning new design patterns (and widgets) can  be confusing - we want to allow users to stick with what works for them  </li>
      						<li>Extra support can be annoying to people who do  not need it  </li>
      						<li>Making content predictable is necessary for  accessibility but can often be considered boring design  </li>
      						<li>Ability to change levels of complexity (increase  or decrease) - As people skills improve or decrease over time or context.  </li>
      						<li>Enable us to really meet the user needs  </li>
    					</ul>
				<p></p>
    				<p>Some users need extra support. This can include: </p>
                			<ul>
                 				<li> Symbols and graphics that they are familiar with </li>
                        			<li> Tool tips </li>
                        			<li> Language they understand </li>
                        			<li> Less features </li>
                        			<li> Separating advertisements, so they do not confuse them with native content </li>
                        			<li> Keyboard short cuts                </li>
                		</ul>
                		<p>For this we need standardized terms and supportive syntax that can be linked to associated symbols, terms, translations and explanations for the individual use via an attribute and personal preferences. </p>
                		<p>For example, assume  an author can make it programanticaly known that a button is used to send an email. At at the user end, the button could be renderer with a symbol, term, and/or tooltips that is understandable for this particular user. It could automatically imply F1 help that explains the send function in simple terms. It could be identified with a keyboard short cut that will always be used for send. In addition it could be identified as important and always rendered, or rendered as a large button. </p>
                		<p>Working examples of how this could be used in practice, with user preferences, are available at <a href="https://github.com/ayelet-seeman/coga.personalisation">https://github.com/ayelet-seeman/coga.personalisation</a>. This is a project to help personalization for any use - including   people with learning and memory issues. It is described more at: <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/cognitive-a11y-tf/wiki/Easy_Personalization">https://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/cognitive-a11y-tf/wiki/Easy_Personalization</a>. </p>
				<p></p>
        			<p>This project consists of 4 parts:</p>
    					<ol>
          					<li><a href="https://github.com/ayelet-seeman/coga.personalisation/tree/JSON-Script">JSON files for user setting</a></li>
      						<li>Proposal for new syntax: (This document) <br/></li>
          					<li>An HTML page that uses some of the new  syntax: <a href="https://github.com/ayelet-seeman/coga.personalisation/tree/ExampleWebPage/">https://github.com/ayelet-seeman/coga.personalisation/tree/ExampleWebPage/</a></li>
          					<li>Scripts that a web author can use or include that read the user   settings in the JSON files and adapt the page for  the user needs: <a href="https://github.com/ayelet-seeman/coga.personalisation/tree/Script-Options">https://github.com/ayelet-seeman/coga.personalisation/tree/Script-Options</a></li>
        				</ol>
                		<p>This is one example of personalization based on semantics. Others may follow. It is also worth noting that the GPII project is working on making user preferences portable which would also enhance this work.</p>
                		<p>In another use-case we would like to see interoperable symbol set codes for non-verbal people. Products for people who are non vocal often use symbols to help users communicate. These symbols are in fact peoples language. Unfortunately many of these symbols are both subject to copy write and are not interoperable. That means end-users can only use one device, and can not use apps or AT from a different company. An open set of references for symbol codes for these symbol sets however, could be interoperable. That means the end user could use an open source symbol set or buy the symbols and use them across different devices or applications. Symbols could still be proprietary but they would also be interoperable. </p>

                        	<h2>Contextual Personalization</h2>
    				<p>One important factor in optimizing the personalization of a product or  service is to ensure that the personalization is appropriate for the current  context of use. For example, settings that will suit the user of a mobile phone  in their office or home will not be well suited to that user when they are  driving a car. In a home or office, the typical user would probably prefer to send and receive text messages using the keyboard and screen of the mobile phone. However, in the car, voice input and text to speech output would be the most appropriate. In this car context, the profile settings of a typical user  might be very similar to those that a blind user would use in all contexts.</p>

			<h2>Simplification</h2>
                        <p><strong>Requirement</strong>: The user must be able to request a way to identify and differentiate between critical features, medium features and less important features. These need to be defined as important from a user perspective in the content. Typically, critical features may be used by many or most users, 90% of the time or more.

                        <p>These semantics aid simplification. But what content is most useful to a user varies from user to user. For example, men may be more interested in mens clothing, and may not be interested in the more frequently use womens clothing option. For that reason we may add context for elements that will help the personalization agent select the most useful content for a given user. This is also necessary for reminders (see bellow). RDFa may be the best way forward for this aspect.</p>

                 <h2>Adding Context </h2>
                        <p><strong>Requirement:</strong> Having familiar terms and symbols is key to being able to use the web. However what is familiar for one user may be strange for another requiring them to learn new symbols. If a user agent or script knows the context of links, buttons, and other page elements then symbols and text used can be ones that the user understands. This can include: </p>
      <ul>
       <li> Symbols and graphics that they are familiar with </li>
       <li> Tool tips </li>
       <li> Language the use can understand </li>
       <li> Keyboard short cuts </li>
      </ul>
      <p> </p>
      <p>For that we need to standardize supportive syntax and terms that can be linked to associated symbols, terms, translations and explanations, for the individual, via an attribute.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p><strong>Example user experience:</strong>, if an author gives to a button a role "send" then, without any work by the author, the button could be automatically rendered with a symbol, term, and/or tooltips that is understandable by a particular user. It could automatically imply F1 help that explains the send function in simple terms. It could be identified with a keyboard short cut that will always be used for send. In addition it could be identified as important and always rendered, or rendered as a large button. This would enable a consistent UI experience across applications and websites.</p>

           		<p><strong>Requirement: </strong> One important factor in optimizing the personalization of a product or   service is to ensure that the personalization is appropriate for the   current context of use as well as what is relevant for the user. For example a female user with a cognitive disability may need less options, and options that are for men are less likely to be relevant for her and may be demoted to bellow the scroll or placed under a &quot;more option&quot; button.</p>

                        	<p>Note that a lot of this can be done using RDFa.  However it is easy to change the meaning with RDFa and a very basic parser will misinterpret the result. The coga work needs to be usable by as many authors as possible, and not only thoughs who can implement  RDF logic.</p>
                        	<p>Further , personalization setting need to be limited, and RDF can give an unlimited  number of potential options which will make the system unusable. (This is unless we create restrictions and controls on an ontology uses - such as mapping to know ontologies.)</p>
                        	<p>For example, in the code below the property homepage does not refer to the home page of the site but of the person being references.  Beyond declaring the type of data we are dealing with, each typeof                              creates a new blank node with its own distinct properties. </p>

                        <p><strong>Requirement: </strong>We would like to enable interoperable symbol set codes for Non verbal people. Products for people who are non vocal often use symbols to help users communicate. These symbols are in fact peoples language. Unfortunately many of these symbols are both subject to copy write AND not interoperable. That means end-users can only use one device, and can not use apps or AT from a different company. There are open set of symbol codes for these symbol sets, that could be referenced then they can be interoperable. alternatively wordnet nodes could be referenced. If the users symbols are mapped to the same nodes then users agents will be able to load the user understandable symbol. That means the end use could buy the symbols and use them across different devices or applications. They would still be proprietary but they would also be interoperable. </p>
      			<p>User experience: AAC users will load symbols that they understand in different applications that are made by a different provider.</p>

    			<h2>Number free</h2>
			<p><strong>Requirement</strong>: Not everyone can understand numbers. We therefor suggest coga-numberfree for alternative text for people who can not understand the main content</p>
			<p><strong>User experience:</strong></p>
			<p>A suggested user experience would be: Numerical concepts could be rendered by the user agent slightly different so that the user knows a number free explanation is available. The user can then mouse over the content and a tooltips would give the number free value</p>
			<section>
			<h3>Proposed attribute: <code>coga-numberfree</code> </h3>
			<p><strong>Supported value : </strong> String</p>
			<p><strong>For example:</strong></p>
			<pre>&lt;span coga-numberfree=&quot;almost all&quot;&gt;9 out of 10 &lt;/span&gt;
			</pre>
			<pre>&lt;span coga-numberfree=&quot;hat and coat weather&quot;&gt;The weather is <span>9 degrees&lt;/span&gt;</span>

			<h2>Non-literal text and images</h2>
			<p><strong>Requirement: </strong>Not everyone can understand non-literal text and icons such as metaphors, idioms etc. We need a tag that identifies text or images as non literal and  allows the author to explain non-literal text and images to users.</p>
			<p><strong>User experience:</strong></p>
			<p>A suggested user experience would be: Non literal content could be rendered by the user agent slightly differently so that the user knows that this content should not be taken literally and that a literal explanation is available. The user can then mouse over the content and a tooltips would give the literal value.</p>
			<section>
			<h3>Proposed attribute: <code>coga-literal</code> </h3>
			<p><strong>Supported value: </strong>String</p>
			<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
			<pre>&lt;span coga-literal=&quot;it is raining hard&quot;&gt; It is <span>raining cats and dogs</span> &lt;/span&gt;</pre>
			<p> User agents can render non-literal text in a different way so that users will know that this is non literal. They can then use a mouse over or other technique to receive the translation.

<p>Some users need additional help. We request an attribute where the author can provide additional information.or what just happened.</p>
			<section>
				<h3>Proposed attribute: <code>coga-feedback</code></h3>
<p>This attribute provides immediate feedback that can be shown or spoken when any event is triggered on a control.</p>
                        <p><strong>User experience: </strong>This can be rendered as text at the top of the page and read immediately. Most users will not want this text rendered and spoken. Other users however will need it to know what has just happened. </p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>Proposed attribute: <code>coga-explain</code></h3>
<p> 
This attribute provides  any information that helps the user anticipate the  functionality, such as letting the user know what behavior will trigger an  event. This is most important if the mechanism is not standard. </p>
<p> User experience: This help can be rendered as a tool tip, help link or read when the control or link is read. Most users will not want this text rendered or spoken, but other users however will need it to understand the behavior of the  element.</p>
		<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
		<pre>coga-explain="press enter to send the email" </pre>
		<pre>coga-feedback="your email on birthdays was sent" </pre>
		<p>These values will change when the email is sent.</p>

			<h2>Language type support</h2>
			<p><strong>Requirement: </strong>Sometimes you may want to provide a simplified version of a section of a page. For example, you may wish to provide a simplified summary of legal document, but still have a longer version for other users. These alternative versions may not be identical in content but maintain the gist of the original content.</p>
			<section>
			<h3>Proposed attribute: <code>coga-alternative</code></h3>
				<p>Would be used on an alternitive content as an alternative to more detailed or difficult to understand content. coga-alternative can be used on a span, div, link or image that servers as alternitive content to it's direct parent element.</p>

			<p><strong>Supported values:</strong> </p>
			<ul>
 				<li>On text: easylang, explain, more, vocab500, vocab1000, vocab2000, active, literal, numberfree, smallsentences, chunks, General: lessoptions. Whitespace, largefont </li>
 				<li>Images: symbolic , realistic</li>
 				<li>p0, p1, p1, p2, p3 Where p0 are images with true content, p1 is a symbol or illustration that is typically shown with alt=&quot;&quot;, P2 are extra illustration that most people will not mind such as at the start of a paragraph or option. p3 are for disability centric illustrations that can disturb other people and may be mid sentence. </li>
				</ul>

			<strong>Example:</strong>
			<pre>&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;span coga-alternative="easylang numberfree vocab1000" class="hidden"&gt;>
    most people prefer simple text
  &lt;/span&gt;
  In studies it was found that only 30% of users prefer long convoluted text 
  with obtuse words and lots of numbers, 
  with 56% claiming there preferred the simplified text , 
  with the remainder unsure or stated it depends on the context.
&lt;/div&gt;</pre>
			</section>
		<section>
			<h3>Proposed attribute: <code>coga-easylang</code> </h3>
			<p><code>coga-easylang</code> will contain a version of the content that is easier to read and understand. Note that this only works on small sections of text as the easylang attribute does not support full HTML, such as lists and sections.</p>

			<p><strong>Supported values:</strong> String</p>
			<pre>&lt;span coga-easylang=&quot; some text that is easy to read&quot;&gt; some convoluted obtuse text&lt;/span&gt;</pre>
			<p>Where coga-easylang should use as simple well-known words as possible, and active voicing, literal text, small simple sentences. Acronyms and abbreviations should be avoided, unless they are the common way to refer to an item.</p>

  <section>
        <h3 id="logs">Logs</h3>
        </section>
        <div> This proposal is to track the tasks that a user has done, so that they can be reminded of them, and return to or fix  a task. The  suggested syntax should allow the author to transform some of the information into breadcrumbs via CSS, and  the user system can read and present more or less information to the user as per their preferences.
          <p>Preferably this should be in the header so that the user agent can build a cross application log of user tasks.</p>
          <p>Notes: </p>
          <p>This is just a proposed syntax. Other syntax may be better.</p>
          <p>For protection of privacy ,it must be easy for the user to delete the log, and prevent the log from being stored.        </p>
        </div>
        <pre>&lt;log name="booking trip"&gt; 
  &lt;step status ="done"&gt; 
    &lt;name&gt;buy ticket&lt;/name&gt;
    &lt;actiontaken&gt;bought ticket to NY return&lt;/actiontaken&gt;
    &lt;view changepossible="yes"&gt;url &lt;/view&gt;
  &lt;/step&gt;
  &lt;step  status ="done"&gt; 
    &lt;name&gt;hotel&lt;/name&gt;
    &lt;actiontaken&gt;booked Sheraton single room&lt;/actiontaken&gt;
    &lt;view changepossible="yes"&gt;url &lt;/view&gt;
  &lt;/step&gt;
  &lt;step  status ="current"&gt; 
    &lt;name&gt;car rental&lt;/name&gt;
    &lt;view current changepossible="yes"/&gt; 
  &lt;/step&gt;
&lt;/log&gt;</pre>

<p>Note that status can have values of :  done, pending , current. Where pending is a step that has not yet been completed but is not the current step.</p>
        <p>An alternative syntax could be:</p>
        <pre>&lt;div role="log" aria-label=&quot;booking trip&quot; aria-hidden="true"/&gt;
</pre>
        <p>Open questions: Should the application name be in the log?</p>

			<h3>Reminders and messages</h3>
			<p><strong>Requirement: </strong>We require an attribute that enables different users to experience different amount of reminders and messages based on personal preferences. Reminders are a wonderful tool for many people with cognitive disabilities. However too many reminders will be annoying or distracting for some other users. Currently people can turn off  distractions such   as skype,  and facebook, across different devices, and then may forget   to turn them back on.</p>
			<p>These semantics allow for different solutions so that users are  able to focus without missing important messages. Users need to manage all distractions by forming a   cross application and cross device distraction matrix that manages all   distractions in one setting. It is based on a matrix for distractions at the operating system ,   browser or cloud level. People and users can be clustered in terms of importance or groups. For   example, the CEO and your child's care giver could both be considered   critical contacts. So even if they do not feel the message is urgent   they can sometimes disrupt the user anyway. Some family members and   important colleagues can be in another group, friends and extended   family in a third group, system messages from the compliance system can   be a different group again. </p>
			<section>
			<h3>Proposed attribute: <code>coga-messageimportance</code></h3>
<p><strong>Supported values: </strong></p>
			<p><strong>critical: </strong>To be critical a message needs to be both urgent and content that the user is very likely to consider important.  For example, a system may send a message that it is going to reboot in one miunet to install updates. </p>
			<p><strong>medium: </strong>Important messages that  needs the user's attention at their convenience. For example, a relatively important  chat message.</p>
			<p><strong>low</strong>: A message that does not need time sensitive attention. For example, a typical chat message</p>
			<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
			<pre>&lt;div role=&quot;alert&quot; 
    coga-messageimportance=&quot;medium&quot;&gt;
  It is your daughter's birthday tomorrow
&lt;/div&gt;</pre>
			</section>
			<section>
			<h3>Proposed attribute: <code>coga-messagefrom</code></h3>
            <p><strong>Supported values: </strong>a string value that identifies the sender of the message. If multiple names are used they can be separated by a coma.</p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
            <pre>&lt;div role=&quot;alert&quot; 
    coga-messageimportance=&quot;low&quot;

			<section>
            <h3>Proposed attribute: <code>coga-messagecontext</code></h3>
            <p><strong>Supported values: </strong><strong> </strong>a string value that identifies the locaction that makes this message relevent. Typical values are &quot;home&quot; nd &quot;work&quot;. If multiple locations are relivent they can be separated by a coma.</p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
            <pre>&lt;div role=&quot;alert&quot;
   coga-messageimportance=&quot;low&quot;

            <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
