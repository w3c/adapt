				<p>This document will be renamed; it is currently referred to as &quot;well-known destinations&quot; for historical reasons.</p>

			<p>This document describes an approach that content authors can use to provide improved ease of navigation to website visitors.</p>

<section id="introduction">
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Web sites can contain a huge array of varied and engaging content.
This content, and the means of navigating around it, can be presented in
almost any way, which makes for tailored and compelling experiences.
However, whilst there are several conventions when it comes to
navigation, this variability can pose challenges to certain people—and
user agents acting on their behalf.</p>
<p>This specification aims to address the challenge of making sites more
easily navigable for both people (particularly those facing
accessibility barriers) and machines. It does this by standardising
machine-readable names for common page types. User Agents can then query
as to which destinations are supported on a given site (or page of that
site), and present this information in an appropriate way for the
user.</p>
<p>The User Agent, or a User Agent extension, could provide an interface
to allow the user to: view supported common pages using a method, and
terminology, that is clear to them; and to request to visit common
destination pages directly.</p>

<h3 id="motivating-use-cases">Motivating Use Cases</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Supporting people facing cognitive accessibility barriers in
navigating sites.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This includes mechanisms that can support clear signposting
within a User Agent to "standard" or "common" areas of sites that users
wish to visit—e.g. "log in", "products", or the site's accessibility
statement.</p></li>
<li><p>This also includes supporting users and accessibility auditors in
quickly discovering the accessibility statement for a site.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Allowing UAs, or other machines, acting on behalf of users to
also find common areas of sites.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="out-of-scope">Out of scope</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Specifying the contents of well-known pages, nor the schema of
any data to be found in one of the common areas of the site, when they
are accessed by machines.</p></li>
<li><p>Specifying the way in which supported well-known pages are
displayed to the user.</p></li>
<li><p>Specifying the interface within the UA (or UA extension) by which
the user can navigate to supported well-known pages.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Though detailed UI design is out of scope, an proof-of-concept UI for
enumerating a site's well-known destinations is depicted below.</p>

				<h2>Use Cases and Requirements</h2>
				<div class=issue>
				<p>This section needs some work.</p>
				</div>

<h3 id="user-research">User research</h3>
<p>Our proposed "well-known destinations" come from work done by the <a
href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/task-forces/coga/">Cognitive and
Learning Disabilities Accessibility Task Force</a>.</p>
<div class="note">
<p>This is not a complete list—we are consulting with COGA to update the
<a
href="https://raw.githack.com/w3c/adapt/CR-content-2022-07-26/content/index.html#values-0">destinations
that the WAI-Adapt TF inherited from COGA</a>.</p>
</div>
<p>An illustrative set of proposed well-known destinations is as
follows...</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>accessibility-statement</code> (for the site's <a
href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/planning/statements/">accessibility
statement</a>)</p></li>
<li><p><code>change-password</code> (as per <a
href="https://www.w3.org/TR/change-password-url/">A Well-known URL for
Changing Passwords</a>)</p></li>
<li><p><code>help</code> (for the site's main help landing
page)</p></li>
<li><p><code>log-in</code></p></li>
<li><p><code>products</code> (for the site's main product section's
landing page)</p></li>
<li><p><code>search</code> (intended for a dedicated search page; a <a
href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.2/#search"><code>search</code>
landmark region</a> would be used on any page that contains a search
form)</p></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="technical-requirements">Technical requirements</h3>
<p>Any approch that would solve these user needs must provide the
following.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>A way to represent each well-known destination proposed
above.</p></li>
<li><p>A mechanism for discovering all well-known destinations supported
by a site—to be used when a UA first visits a site on behalf of the
user. In order to do this efficiently, it must be possible to make this
query in a single HTTP request. The results would be available to the
user via the UI of the UA.</p></li>
<li><p>A way to denote the scope of any particular site (or
sub-site).</p></li>
<li><p>A procedure for visiting a well-known destination directly (when
the user activates the interface in the UA).</p></li>
<li><p>A mechanism by which a well-known destination would be updated
(by the content author).</p></li>
<li><p>Means to identify when a link on a page takes the user to a
sub-page of a well-known destination page. E.g. a link to the "help on
logging in" page (as opposed to the main "help" section landing page,
which is where the well-known destination alone would take the
user).</p></li>
<li><p>Means to demarcate an element on the destination page that
provides the destination content.</p></li>
<li><p>A way to indicate the <em>kind</em> of content that the
destination provides—e.g. people with cognitive disabilities may need to
get help from, or chat to, a human, over the phone, rather than a
chatbot, or sending an email.</p></li>
</ol>
<div class=issue>
<p>The last of these requirements—indicating the <em>kind</em> of
content or support—is currently an open question, not addressed by the
proposed approach below, but may be addressed in a future iteration of
this approach, or by a future WAI-Adapt TF project.</p>
</div>
</section>

<section>
<h2 id="the-well-known-destinations-approach">The "Well-known
destinations" approach</h2>
<p>This involves using the <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> element, and custom
<code>rel</code> attribute values, to signpost well-known destinations
on a site.</p>
<h3 id="the-well-known-destination-namespace">The well-known destination
namespace</h3>
<p>All possible well-known destinations will be registered as
<code>rel</code> attribute values.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>accessibility-statement</code></p></li>
<li><p><code>change-password</code></p></li>
<li><p><code>help</code></p></li>
<li><p><code>log-in</code></p></li>
<li><p><code>products</code></p></li>
<li><p><code>search</code></p></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="enumerating-well-known-destinations">Enumerating well-known
destinations</h3>
<p>On the site's home page, the destinations supported by the site would
be indicated via <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> elements. For example:</p>

<aside class=example>
<pre class=html>
. . .
&lt;head&gt;
  . . .
  &lt;link rel=&quot;accessibility-statement&quot; href=&quot;/accessibility-statement&quot;&gt;
  &lt;link rel=&quot;help&quot; href=&quot;/support&quot;&gt;
  &lt;link rel=&quot;log-in&quot; href=&quot;/sign-in&quot;&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
</pre>
</aside>

<p>This will provide an overview of the available destinations.</p>
<div class="note">
<p>All destinations need to be repeated on all pages of the site.
(This is one reason why the URLs in the example begin with
<code>/</code>).</p>
</div>
<h3 id="defining-a-site">Defining a site</h3>
<p>Because all destinations are repeated on all pages of a site, if we
move to a sub-site, the sub-site will expose all destinations on all of
its pages, and thus the UA/AT will be able to present the correct
destinations for the sub-site.</p>
<h3 id="visiting-a-well-known-destination-directly">Visiting a
well-known destination directly</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>The user selects the well-known destination in the UI of their
UA.</p></li>
<li><p>The corresponding URL is loaded.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="updating-a-well-known-destination">Updating a well-known
destination</h3>
<p>The content author would need to ensure that the
<code>&lt;link&gt;</code> elements sent are correct. In practice this
would most likely be managed by the CMS powering the site, which could
take the repetition out of the authoring process.</p>
<h3
id="expressing-when-a-link-points-to-part-of-a-well-known-destination">Expressing
when a link points to part of a well-known destination</h3>
<p>When an in-page (anchor, <code>&lt;a&gt;</code>) link points to a
page that is a sub-page of a well-known destination (such as the "help
on logging in" page, rather than the "help" home page), this can be
indicated by adding a <code>rel</code> value to the anchor.</p>
<aside class=example>
<pre class=html>
&lt;p&gt;For more details, consult the &lt;a href=&quot;/help/signing-in&quot; rel=&quot;help&quot;&gt;help section on signing in to your account&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
</pre>
</aside>

<h3 id="demarcating-destination-content">Demarcating destination
content</h3>
<p>As well-known destinations are normal links, they can make use of
fragments to point to certain elements on the destination page.</p>
<p>The content/UA/AT can then use this information (and the knowledge that the
navigation was via the Well-known destination UI) to render the
destination page in an appropriate way for the user.</p>
