		<h3>Description</h3>
		<div class="property-description">
            <p>The <code>distraction</code> attribute is intended to be used on non-essential content, so that people who have problems keeping focus can minimize, re-order or turn the content off. An example user-experience would be to hide all non-essential content.</p>
			<p>Note that there is no default value.</p>
			<p>Note that elements with the <code>distraction</code> attribute should also have a label or accessible name.</p>
			
			<p>It has been noted that advertising constitutes the critical revenue stream for many content providers. The purpose of allowing users to hide (or systematically show and sequentially review) on-page advertising is simply to give distracted users the same control others have over such content. The user without a disability can ignore the advertisement and complete the task. The user who cannot ignore it, or TAB past it conveniently, is forced to grapple with a stumbling block that prevents them from completing a task.</p>
			<p>Users will choose to look at advertising because it's informative. It's an important mechanism for learning about options in life. By allowing users to control when and how they see ads, they have the ability to avoid becoming frustrated by processes that prevent task completion. This allows them to see advertising as potentially useful information, not a source of frustration. The alternative is that a frustrated user will not follow up on the ad that caused the frustration.</p>
			<div class="note"><p>The distraction attribute may appear to have some common features with the CSS prefers-reduced-motion media feature, however there are some significant differences:</p>
				<ul>
				<li>the distraction attribute is applying semantics at the element level, whereas the CSS media feature is presentational and semantics-free.</li>
				<li>the CSS prefers-reduced-motion media feature requires that the content author also provide an alternative experience for users who have the Reduced Motion option enabled - the distraction attribute does not.</li>
				<li>the CSS prefers-reduced-motion media feature anticipates a reduced presentation, the distraction attributes anticipates that the content can be minimize, re-ordered or even turned off (hidden) from the end user.</li>
				</ul>

		<h3>Examples</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>Example using the <code>distraction</code> attribute in the context of an animated image.       
   		<pre class="example" title="Distraction Using data-distraction">
		  &lt;img src="animated.gif" alt="animated banner advertising for Widgets" 
		    data-distraction="sensory offer"&gt;</pre></li>
			<li>Example using the <code>distraction</code> attribute in the context of a stock ticker that starts and displays upon page load.       
   		<pre class="example" title="Distraction Using data-distraction">
		  &lt;div data-distraction="sensory messages" class="stockticker-widget-container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</pre></li>
			<li>Example using the <code>distraction</code> attribute in the context of a count-down timer that starts at the userâ€™s request and updates in real-time the hours, minutes, and seconds until an event starts (or ends).       
   		<pre class="example" title="Distraction Using data-distraction">
		  &lt;div data-distraction="sensory" class="countdown-widget-container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</pre></li>
		  <li>Example using the <code>distraction</code> attribute in the context of an audio clip that is played
each time a step in a sequence of steps on a set of web pages is completed. Some users may find this sound distracting.
<pre class="example" title="Distraction Using data-distraction">
&lt;audio src="step-complete.mp3" data-distraction="sensory"&gt;</pre></li>
<li>Example where haptic feedback is provided when items are added into a shopping cart. The user's device is fixed onto their wheelchair and the haptic feedback is distracting because it rattles the device within the mount. Implementation of this scenario may rely on the <a href="https://notifications.spec.whatwg.org/#alerting-the-user">Notification API</a> to implement the haptic feedback.</li>
