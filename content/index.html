			<p>This document provides use cases and a vocabulary of terms that can be used to enhance web content by providing information about form controls, symbols, and other user interface elements. User agents use the semantics to augment or adapt content to the user’s scenario. This helps users with varying needs to understand the content by providing support for simplification and a way to manage unnecessary distractions.</p>
			<p>The Personalization Semantics Content Module 1.0 is an extension of the personalization semantics introduced in the <a href="../">Personalization Semantics Explainer 1.0</a> document [[personalization-semantics-1.0]].</p>

			<h1>Introduction</h1>
     
            <p>This document provides personalization semantics and vocabularies that can be used to annotate web content enabling user agents to augment or adapt content to various user scenarios based on the user’s personalization settings or preferences.</p>
			
			<p class="ednote" id="examples-disclaimer">Personalization semantics defines a set of properties and values to annotate content. The specific mechanism to apply these properties to content has not been decided. <a href="https://github.com/w3c/personalization-semantics/wiki/Comparison-of-ways-to-use-vocabulary-in-content">Several approaches are under consideration</a> and future drafts will show progress. To help with understanding of the properties, this document provides many examples of personalization semantics applied to content, which show attributes beginning with the prefix "aui-". <em>This has not been decided as the chosen approach</em>, but the simplicity supports understanding of the examples.</p>

			<h1>Use Cases and Requirements</h1>
			<p>The <a href="../requirements/">Requirements for Personalization Semantics</a> describes use cases and requirements. This module provides properties to fulfill requirements related to adaptable content.</p>
