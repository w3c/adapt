		<h3>Description</h3>
		<div class="property-description">
							<p>The <code>simplification</code> attribute differentiates between critical features and less important features for simplification.</p>
							<p>This allows simplified interfaces with less options or interfaces that emphasize critical features. Adaptations can be based on personalization settings. </p>
							<p>Note that this attribute can only take a single token value, and there is no default value.</p>

		<h3>Examples</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>An example using the <code>simplification</code> attribute in the context of a submit button.
		    	<pre class="example" title="Simplification Using data-simplification">
    	&lt;input value="Submit" type="submit" data-simplification="critical"/&gt;</pre></li>
			<li>In this example, the <code>simplification</code> attribute is used on critical content &mdash; a newsletter from an elementary school. Important announcements about an early school dismissal is in a list of other activities. If this important information is missed, the parents might not be home in time, putting children at risk.
		      	<pre class="example" title="Simplification Using data-simplification">
&lt;p&gt;Years 2 - 3 are putting on a play next Tuesday. 
		&lt;b data-simplification="critical"&gt;Thefore school will close at 1 pm on Tuesday &lt;/b&gt; 
		so we can get the school hall ready.&lt;/p&gt;</pre></li>
