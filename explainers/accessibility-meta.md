## Introduction

Accessibility statements provide detailed information from a site developer about:

* Which assistive technologies they support.
* Known issues.
* Plans for further accessibility improvements.
* Contact details so that visitors can request help, or report problems.

This spec provides a standard schema for providing this information, with the following goals.

## Motivating Use Cases

* Improved consistency of accessibility statements across sites.
  - This will make the statements more useful for humans.
* Make the statements machine readable.

> **TODO:** Prediction: machine readability may give some organisations concerns (as it makes researching easier).

## Non-goals

* Specifying the _location_ (URI) of the accessibility statement. This is the subject of a separate specification.
* Providing the means for accessibility reporting, in the following ways. Both of these are covered by a separate specification.
  - Providing the means for accessibility test results to be automatically, semi-automatically, or manually reported.
  - Providing the means for people to report difficulties they are having on a given page.
