			<h1>Introduction</h1>
			<p>This document lists examples of the personalized help and support properties, this is an extension of <a href="../">Personalization Explainer 1.0</a>. including the properties of <code>literal</code>, <code>numberfree</code>, <code>easylang</code>, <code>alternative</code>, <code>explain</code>, <code>feedback</code>, <code>moreinfo</code>, <code>extrahelp</code>, <code>helptype</code>. </p>

			<p class="ednote" id="examples-disclaimer">Personalization semantics defines a set of properties and values to annotate content. The specific mechanism to apply these properties to content and semantics has not been decided. <a href="https://github.com/w3c/personalization-semantics/wiki/Comparison-of-ways-to-use-vocabulary-in-content">Several approaches are under consideration</a> and future drafts will show progress. To help understand the proposed properties, this document provides many examples of personalization semantics applied to content, which show attributes beginning with the prefix "data-". <em>This prefix has not been decided on as the definitive approach</em>, but is used as a way to illustrate the examples.</p>

				<h2>Example Implementations</h2>
				<p>The Working Group is currently exploring different methods of implementing help and support in the context of the Personalization effort. The following examples are for illustration only, to assist in visualizing how this may work. The examples illustrate &quot;large&quot; amounts of alternative content, contained inline but hidden from traditional views. This content would be exposed to the end user on demand. For smaller pieces of content, additional information and support can be provided inline within the relative context of the content.</p>
				<p class="ednote">Currently all examples are implemented through attribute/value pairs. This does not imply that attribute/value pairs are the only implementation strategy. The Working Group plans to add additional examples using other mechanisms as previously indicated.</p>
