			<p>This specification provides web content authors a standard approach to support web users who are persons with various cognitive and learning disabilities who:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Customarily communicate using symbolic languages generally known as Augmentative and Alternative Communications (<abbr title="Augmentative and Alternative Communication">AAC</abbr>);</li>
				<li>Need more familiar icons (and other graphical symbols) in order to comprehend page content;</li>
			</ul>

			<p>The technology described in this specification is intended to be used to programmatically transform the appearance of typical web content including form controls, icons, and other user interface elements	into a rendering incorporating an individual user's preferred AAC symbols. The W3C <a href="https://w3c.github.io/adapt-registry/">WAI-Adapt Symbols Registry</a> provides the required mappings between concept values used by content authors and the user's preferred AAC symbol set representation of that concept.</p>
			<p>This WAI-Adapt: Symbols Module is a component of the WAI-Adapt series introduced in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/adapt/">WAI-Adapt Explainer</a> document [[adapt]].</p>

			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<section>
				<h3>Background</h3>
				<p>This specification module enables authors to add semantic information about content at the element level, in order to facilitate a more familiar and comprehensible interface for the individual user who requires AAC symbols support. Final renderings &mdash; generated via helper apps or 3rd-party tools &mdash; are ultimately defined by the user's configuration settings.</p>

				<p>The goal of the attribute and values described in this specification is to enable personalized communication and web content interaction for the individual user. This specification includes facilities to:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Transform the user interface (UI) through adaptation of content by injection of AAC symbols and thus ameliorate the negative impact of content lacking AAC on Augmentative and Alternative Communications (<abbr title="Augmentative and Alternative Communication">AAC</abbr>) users;</li>
					<li>Provide extra support to the user by providing the communication modality they are best able to comprehend;</li>
					<li>Enable new adapted user agents for people with learning and cognitive disabilities.</li>
				</ul>

				<p>WAI-Adapt is more fully introduced in our <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/adapt/">WAI-Adapt Explainer</a> [[adapt]].</p>

				<h3>WAI-Adapt: Symbols Module</h3>
				<p>WAI-Adapt: Symbols Module is the first part of the WAI-Adapt technical specification, which provides WAI-Adapt and vocabularies that can be used to mark-up web content with additional semantic information, enabling user agents to augment or adapt content to various user-scenarios based on the user’s personalization settings or preferences. The Symbols Module allows authors to enhance web content by providing additional information about the meaning of specific parts of the content. User agents use these semantics to augment or adapt content to the user's preferred symbol set. This helps users with varying needs better understand the content.</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>Vocabulary Structure and Implementations</h3>
				<p>The vocabulary in WAI-Adapt: Symbols Module is constructed of properties and their values. Please see our <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/adapt/">WAI-Adapt Explainer</a>. </p>
				<p>The vocabulary implementation included in this module specification is available at our <a href="https://github.com/w3c/adapt/wiki/Implementations-of-Semantics">implementations wiki page</a>.</p>
				<section id="properties">
					<h4>Properties</h4>
					<p>Properties are the main units of WAI-Adapt types supported by the vocabulary. A given property supports a specific type of personalization. That property would only be used once on a given piece of content, but multiple different properties could be used on the same piece of content to address different needs.</p>
				</section>
				<section id="propcharacteristic_value">
					<h4 id="vocabulary_values">Values</h4>
					<p>Values provide the specific WAI-Adapt information for the property. The possible values for each property are elaborated in the definition of the property in the modules. Some properties require the value to come from a predefined list of possible values, others can accept arbitrary strings, and some may accept multiple values. The attribute value may be one of the following types:</p>
					<dl>
						<dt id="valuetype_idref">ID reference</dt>
						<dd>Reference to the ID of another element in the same document</dd>
						<dt id="valuetype_idref_list">ID reference list</dt>
						<dd>A list of one or more ID references.</dd>
						<dt id="valuetype_integer">integer</dt>
						<dd>A numerical value without a fractional component.</dd>
						<dt id="valuetype_number">number</dt>
						<dd>Any real numerical value.</dd>
						<dt id="valuetype_string">string</dt>
						<dd>Unconstrained value type.</dd>
						<dt id="valuetype_token">token</dt>
						<dd>One of a limited set of allowed values.</dd>
						<dt id="valuetype_token_list">token list</dt>
						<dd>A list of one or more tokens.</dd>
						<dt id="valuetype_uri">URI</dt>
						<dd>A Uniform Resource Identifier as defined by <cite><a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3986.txt" id="bib-rfc3986">RFC 3986</a></cite> [<cite><a class="bibref" data-link-type="biblio" href="#bib-rfc3986" title="Uniform Resource Identifier (URI): Generic Syntax">RFC3986</a></cite>] It may reference a separate document, or a content fragment identifier in a separate document, or a content fragment identifier within the same document.</dd>
					</dl>
				</section>
				<p><strong>Note that the attributes and values in this specification do not override the semantics exposed in the accessibility tree, but rather augment them.</strong> In the case of conflict between an element's semantics and the attribute values, validation algorithms should issue a warning but not an error.</p>
				<div class="note">Since implementations have not yet been finalized, any examples in this document are illustrative only, and are provided to help in understanding the concept.  All examples will be updated once implementation examples are finalized.</div>

				<h3>Use Cases and Requirements</h3>
				<p>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/adapt-requirements/">Requirements document for WAI-Adapt</a> describes use cases and requirements which, in turn, are derived from the user scenarios and use cases published in the W3C Note, <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/coga-usable/">Making Content Usable for People with Cognitive and Learning Disabilities</a>. This specification module provides one key component to fulfil those requirements related to adapting content to support AAC symbols.</p>

			<h2>Terms</h2>
			<p>This document uses a number of specific terms related to various cognitive disabilities and related user-needs. Those terms have been defined by the Cognitive and Learning Disabilities Accessibility Task Force. See the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/coga-usable/#glossary">COGA Glossary</a> for specific definitions.</p>
		</section>

		<section id="conformance">
			<p>The main content of WAI-Adapt is sets of attributes with defined value ranges. Authors MAY use these attributes in HTML content to enhance personalization capabilities of the content. The sections may contain examples of recommended practice, but it is not required to follow those approaches in order to conform to this specification.</p>
			<p>User agents MAY implement any set of attributes from this specification. If a user agent implements an Adapt attribute, it MUST provide support for all possible values of that attribute.</p>

			<h2>Privacy and Security Considerations</h2>
			<p>This specification adds context information about content to the document, and should not affect security.</p>

			<p>Although this specification does not expose personal preferences and personal information, third party user agents or proxy server(s) acting upon our semantic information may need to store personal preferences on how to present content to a specific user. It is recommended that any user agent or proxy server implements best practices to protect all personal preferences and personal information.</p>

			<p>Any user agent with user settings are recommended to follow best practices to keep user information secure.</p>
			<p>The Privacy and Security Considerations of WAI-Adapt: Symbols Module is also discussed at <a href="https://github.com/w3c/adapt/issues/131">issue #131</a>.</p>
		</section>

		<section class="appendix">
			<h2>Candidate Recommendation Exit Criteria</h2>
			<p>The WAI Adapt Symbols Module 1.0 specification consists of attributes that may be added to a page’s HTML at the website’s discretion. A user agent may take suitable rendering decisions based on these attributes.</p>
			<aside class="example" title="A browser extension for rendering symbols">
				<p>A browser extension or stand-alone tool may have a mode that renders the appropriate symbol for an input label.</p>
				<code>
					&lt;label for="home" <strong>adapt-symbol="14885"</strong>&gt;Your Principle Residence&lt;/label&gt; <br>
					&lt;input type="textarea" id="home" name="address" autocomplete="street-address"&gt;
				</code>
				<p>Where the symbol value 14855 maps back to "Home".</p>
			</aside>
			<p>For the specification to exit Candidate Review status: for each attribute-value pair in the specification, at least two user agents (or extensions to existing user agents) react to the attribute in an identifiable manner which is suited to the semantics of the attribute.</p>
			<p>For clarity, we note:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><p>While the WAI-Adapt standard stipulates HTML value/attribute markup codes for use by page authors, implementations to meet exit criteria are focused on rendering of the markup.</p></li>
				<li><p>For user agents (or extensions) rendering a given attribute, all values for that attribute must be supported.</p></li>
				<li><p>The results of testing are made available in a separate <a href="
																						https://w3c.github.io/adapt/symbols/reports/">implementation report</a>.</p></li>
